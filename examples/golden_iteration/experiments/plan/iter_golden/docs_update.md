## What Changed
- Added results summary and metric delta notes for iteration `iter_golden`.

## Run Evidence
- iteration_id: iter_golden
- run_id: 20260201T120000Z_demo
- host mode: local
- sync status: completed

## Recommendation
- Proceed with replication runs before marking hypothesis complete.

## No-Change Rationale (when applicable)
- metrics delta summary: +1.2 absolute validation accuracy.
- why configured paper targets do not require updates: target write-up deferred until replication confirms stability.
