## HARD GUARDRAILS (READ FIRST)
- Do not modify experiments already marked completed in `.autolab/backlog.yaml` (including `done`, `completed`, `closed`, `resolved`) unless a human explicitly re-opens them.
- If the mapped experiment is already `done`, `completed`, `closed`, or `resolved`, stop and do not edit that experiment until explicitly re-opened.
- Never create literal placeholder paths, including unresolved paths with missing IDs:
  - `experiments//design.yaml`
  - `runs//metrics.json`
  - `experiments/{{iteration_id}}/runs/{{run_id}}/`
  - `experiments/{{iteration_id}}/...` (unresolved braces)
- Never leave explicit unresolved template markers such as:
  - `{{iteration_id}}`
  - `{{run_id}}`
  - `<TODO>`
  - `TODO:`
  - `TBD`
  - `FIXME`
- Never leave unresolved placeholders such as `{{...}}`, `<TODO>`, `TBD`, or `FIXME` in required outputs.
